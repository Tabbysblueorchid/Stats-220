# Stats-220
# This is my demo repo for STATS 220 :)
## I will use this for demonstrating my process of learning coding in STATS 220.
**Things I want to experiment with using coding:**
<!--- numbered lists --->
1. Minecraft modding:
<!--- unordered lists --->
* Tweaking with biomes, *especially* the new 🌸 biome.
* Enhancing the graphics to make them more or less dramatic.
* Adding 🍵 and ☕︎ for that energy during adventures.
2. Create more expressive and custom digital art.
3. Generating knitting and crocheting patterns using custom codes.
